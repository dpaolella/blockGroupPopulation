# blockGroupPopulation
Compiles a US Block Group, race/ethnicity-specific population data for years 2000 and 2007-2014. Data are based on the US Census for years 2000 and 2010 and the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for years 2007-2009 and 2011-2014 (our methodology assumes that ACS 2005-2009 estimates are the best approximation of 2007 population and so on for each 5-year span of ACS data).

Population data for each year are joined to US Block Group polygons and saved as shapefiles.

Repository does not include US Block Group polygons due to file size. Shapefiles can be downloaded for each year from nhgis.org.
